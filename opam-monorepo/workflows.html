Everybody gets a consistent view of the dependencies, but developers are responsible for running <code>opam monorepo pull</code>.</li><li><em>duniverse-in-git</em>: check lockfile and duniverse folder into Git. This ensures that the repository is self-contained, but it can be very large.</li><li><em>not-locked</em>: Everybody is responsible for generating a lockfile. Different people can end up with different dependencies. This is not really an <code>opam-monorepo</code> workflow, but it is a way <code>opam-monorepo</code> can be used to build a project even if it doesn't use <code>opam-monorepo</code>.</li></ul><p>As a summary:</p><ul><li><em>lockfile-in-git</em>: opam file and lockfile checked in, duniverse ignored.</li><li><em>duniverse-in-git</em>: opam file, lockfile and duniverse checked in.</li><li><em>not-locked</em>: opam file checked in, lockfile and duniverse not checked in.</li></ul><p>We recommend using the <em>lockfile-in-git</em> workflow. To enable it, first generate a lockfile (using <code>opam monorepo lock</code>), add it to your Git repository, together with <code>project.opam</code>, and add <code>duniverse/</code> in <code>.gitignore</code>.</p><h3 id="setting-up-continuous-integration"><a href="#setting-up-continuous-integration" class="anchor"></a>Setting Up Continuous Integration</h3><p>Note: if you use <a href="https://ci.ocamllabs.io/">ocaml-ci</a>, you don't have anything to do. It will detect <code>opam-monorepo</code> builds and replace the Opam-based builds by an <code>opam-monorepo</code> aware build that implements the rest of this section.</p><p>This section is useful if you want to implement a CI system based on <code>opam-monorepo</code>.</p><p>A build consists in three steps:</p><ol><li>Set up the environment</li><li>Set up the workspace</li><li>Build the project</li></ol><h4 id="set-up-the-environment"><a href="#set-up-the-environment" class="anchor"></a>Set Up the Environment</h4><p>In this context, &quot;the environment&quot; is a set of programs to be put in <code>$PATH</code>. An <code>opam-monorepo</code> build requires an OCaml compiler, Dune, and <code>opam-monorepo</code>. The project might require system packages (&quot;depexts&quot;) too. It's possible to rely on <code>opam</code> to install this environment, but it's not technically required.</p><p>The following assumes that Opam is being used.</p><p>To set up the environment:</p><ul><li>It's only necessary to have access to the lockfile (the Opam file, Duniverse folder, and source code are not used)</li><li>Create an Opam switch compatible with the OCaml version mentioned in the lockfile</li><li>Install Dune. The latest version usually works</li><li>Install <code>opam-monorepo</code>. The version to pick depends the lockfile format version (<code>x-opam-monorepo-version</code> field in the lockfile). The rule is that a lockfile with version <em>0.N</em> can be interpreted by <code>opam-monorepo</code> version <code>0.N.*</code>, but in most cases, <code>opam-monorepo</code> can read older versions. As <code>opam-monorepo</code> reaches version 1.0.0, more stability guarantees will exist.</li><li>Install depexts. Since format version 0.2, all depexts are recorded in the lockfile, so they can be listed using <code>opam show -f depexts
  ./project.opam.locked</code>. In a future version, a command <code>opam monorepo depext</code> will provide a way to install them directly.</li></ul><h4 id="setup-the-workspace"><a href="#setup-the-workspace" class="anchor"></a>Setup the Workspace</h4><p>The next step is to set up a workspace that contains your project and its dependencies.</p><ul><li>This step requires access to the lockfile and a way to download Opam packages.</li><li>Run <code>opam monorepo pull</code>.</li></ul><h4 id="build-the-project"><a href="#build-the-project" class="anchor"></a>Build the Project</h4><p>In this step, the workspace is ready, so <code>dune build</code> commands can succeed. The exact command to run depends on the project, but for CI, <code>dune build</code> followed by <code>dune runtest</code> is usually the right thing to do (or in a single step, <code>dune
build @all @runtest</code>). If the goal of that pipeline is to produce release binaries, passing <code>--profile release</code> might be better. Consult the Dune documentation to know more about the difference.</p><h4 id="caching-strategies"><a href="#caching-strategies" class="anchor"></a>Caching Strategies</h4><p>This build skeleton can benefit from several caching strategies. The first one is to use a layering approach, e.g., by using Docker.</p><p>Most of the steps only require the lockfile, so they can be cached and invalidated when the lockfile changes.</p><p>For the OCaml compiler version, this can be a bit too conservative, as it will cause any change in the lockfile to rebuild a switch. Instead, it's possible to hardcode the OCaml compiler version in the Docker file, and only check that the version is correct during the &quot;setup environment&quot; phase.</p><p>Doing only this will start all builds with an empty <code>_build</code> directory, so all dependencies need to be built each time. One solution to this is to persist the <code>_build</code> directory between builds. This can even be done across branches (the cache key is just the project name).</p><p>For local development, this means that <code>_build</code> is expensive to rebuild (similarly to a local Opam switch). It is possible to set up a machine-global <a href="https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/caching.html">dune cache</a> to speed up rebuilds.</p><h3 id="upgrading-all-dependencies"><a href="#upgrading-all-dependencies" class="anchor"></a>Upgrading all Dependencies</h3><p>To upgrade dependencies, run <code>opam monorepo lock</code>. It will compute a new solution based on the constraints in <code>project.opam</code> and the current state of opam-repository. Then locally run <code>opam monorepo pull</code> to update the <code>duniverse/</code> folder.</p><p>It is recommended to regularly create pull requests to update dependencies. When updating a local copy, developers will need to call <code>opam monorepo pull</code>.</p><h3 id="adding-a-dependency"><a href="#adding-a-dependency" class="anchor"></a>Adding a Dependency</h3><p>Note: this section also applies to all the cases where there are changes to the dependencies in <code>project.opam</code>, for example if a version constraint is modified.</p><p>To add a dependency:</p><ul><li>Add it to <code>project.opam</code> (directly or if you use opam file generation, add it to <code>dune-project</code> and run <code>dune build</code>).</li><li>Regenerate the lock file using <code>opam monorepo lock</code>.</li><li>Locally update the <code>duniverse/</code> folder using <code>opam monorepo pull</code>.</li><li>Open a PR with the changes to <code>project.opam</code>, the lockfile and optionally <code>dune-project</code>.</li></ul><p>This has the side effect of upgrading all dependencies too. To get a more conservative upgrade, one can do the upgrade in two steps:</p><ul><li>First, open a PR to update all dependencies as described above.</li><li>Then open a PR adding a dependency. It will only contain changes relevant to that dependency.</li></ul></div></body></html>
