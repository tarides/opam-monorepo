Rresult — Result value combinators for OCaml
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
v0.7.0+dune

Rresult is an OCaml module for handling computation results and errors
in an explicit and declarative manner, without resorting to
exceptions. It defines combinators to operate on the `result` type
available from OCaml 4.03 in the standard library.

OCaml 4.08 provides the `Stdlib.Result` module which you should prefer
to Rresult.

Rresult is distributed under the ISC license.
