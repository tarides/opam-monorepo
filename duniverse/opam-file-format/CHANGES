2.1.3 [21 May 2021]
-------------------
* Fix module link order (broken by #37) [#41 @dra27]
* opam-version: "2.1" must appear at most once and as the first non-comment
  item. If opam-version is at the start and is greater than the library version,
  `OpamLexer.Error` and `Parsing.Parse_error` are no longer raised; instead the
  opam-version variable is returned along with an invalid group to signal the
  parsing error, giving the client enough information to act.
