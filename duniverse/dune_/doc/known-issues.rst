`mli`-Only Modules
==================

Dune supports `mli`-only moduces; however, using them might make it impossible
for non-Dune users to use your library. We tried to use them for some internal
modules generated by Dune, but it broke the build of projects not using Dune:

https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/567

So, while they are supported, be careful where you use them. Using a `.ml`-only
module is still preferable.

Parallel Dune Invocations on the Same Tree
==========================================

One can invoke Dune multiple times in parallel, as long as the invocations
don't live under the same root. In other words, two Dune runs cannot share the
same target `_build` directory.

This is tracked under https://github.com/ocaml/dune/issues/236.
