    very similar to interpreting the stanza and compiling it down to low-level
    rules.

    As a result, we proceed as follow: we interpret the stanza into rules and
    extract the targets of the computed rule. This function returns these rules.

    However, if the directory is part of a group, this function simply returns
    the root of the group. *)
