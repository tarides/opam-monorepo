(** Expand an action and return its target and dependencies.

    Expanding an action substitutes all [%{..}] forms, discovers dependencies
    and targets, and verifies invariants such as:

    - All the targets are in [targets_dir]
    - The [targets] mode is respected

    [foreign_flags] has to be passed because it depends on [Super_context].
    Fetching it directly would introduce a dependency cycle. *)
