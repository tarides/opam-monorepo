(** [extend_build_path_prefix_map env how map] extends the path rewriting rules
    encoded in the [BUILD_PATH_PREFIX_MAP] variable.

    Note that the rewriting rules are applied from right to left, so the last
    rule of [map] will be tried first.

    If the environment variable is already defined in [env], [how] explains
    whether the rules in [map] should be tried before or after the existing
    ones. *)
