(** A value of type [Run.t] represents a run of the build system and is used in
    the memoization framework as a dependency of functions that need to be
    recomputed on every build run.

    In the batch mode, there is only one run, so the [is_current t] predicate
    always returns [true]. In the file-watching mode, there may be multiple
    runs, separated by calls to [restart].

    Upon [restart], all previously created [Run.t] values stop being current, so
    the subsequent calls of [is_current] on these values will return [false]. *)
type t

val to_dyn : t -> Dyn.t

(** Return the current run. *)
val current : unit -> t

(** Check whether this run is the current one. *)
val is_current : t -> bool

(** Compare runs: the current run is greater than earlier ones. *)
val compare : t -> t -> Ordering.t

(** End the current run and start a new one. *)
val restart : unit -> unit
