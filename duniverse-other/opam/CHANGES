  - review `sync_dirty` on VCS:
    - use VCS to synchronize, then rsync & remove others files
    - exclude `_build`, `_opam` & VCS directories
  - when `--inplace-build` is given, it does a dirty synchronization of the
    sources, in order to keep tracking package stats (clean, local or dirty).

  the MCCS library exists even if it couldn't detect it. [#3572 @dra27]

  and `--with-doc`

  output selection
* Delay the removals of packages as much as possible, avoiding most cases of
  mass uninstalled packages after a build failure

  defined in `~/.opam/config`; include sample Linux wrappers to restrict process
  permissions (e.g. ensure `build:` doesn't install)
